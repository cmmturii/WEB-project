        Farm lease products refer to legal agreements and related services that facilitate the rental of agricultural land, equipment, or facilities between landowners and farmers. These products help landowners generate income from their property while enabling farmers to access land and resources without purchasing them outright. Key types include:Cash Rent Leases: The tenant pays a fixed amount per acre or a set rate for land use, offering simplicity and predictable income for landowners. The tenant bears most risks (e.g., crop failure) but has freedom in farming decisions.

Crop-Share Leases: The landowner and tenant share crop yields (and often input costs like fertilizer) based on a predetermined ratio, tying income to production success and sharing risks/rewards.

Flexible Leases: Rent adjusts based on crop yields or market prices, balancing risk between parties and adapting to economic conditions.

Equipment and Facility Leases: Agreements for leasing farm buildings, storage bins, or machinery, often with tax benefits and flexible financing options to support farm operations.

Specialized Leases: Include grazing leases for livestock, agroforestry leases for perennial crops, or creative leases (e.g., lease-to-own or conservation-focused), tailored to specific farming needs or sustainability goals.
